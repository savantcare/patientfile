Goal:  When looking at a region of code I do not need to have expereince with other code

1. When I look at variable, array, function, object, component the name should tell me what it is

   1. How are the different function types distinguished ?
      apiGetAge -> This is api function
      cfGetAge -> This is computed function
      wfGetAge -> This is a watch function
      mfGetAge -> This is method function
      fnGetAge -> This is a non categorized function
   2. How are different variable types distinguished?
      vsAge -> This is variable of type string
      vnAge -> This is variable of type int
      vbAge -> This is variable of type bool

2. Short names
   1. appt -> Appointment
   2. ar -> Array
   3. fn -> Function
   4. ct -> Component
   5. ob -> Object
   6. v -> Variable
