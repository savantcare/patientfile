Short forms in code:

1. appt -> Appointment
2. ar -> Array
3. fn -> Function
4. ct -> Component
5. ob -> Object
6. v -> Variable

Naming Goals:

1. When I look at variable, array, function, object, component the name should tell me what it is
2. Short names
3. If a function call is a api call the name will tell me it is a API call. Since API is a subset of fn so you do not need to repeat fn
