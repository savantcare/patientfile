# Code format guidelines

1. Tell VS Code to auto format the code on save
   Code -> preferences -> Settings -> "Format on save"
   (This is not set by default)

2. Code -> preferences -> Settings -> HTML â€º Format: Wrap Line Length
   120 (This is default no need to change)

3. Editor: Insert Spaces -> Insert spaces when pressing Tab
   On (This is default no need to change)
